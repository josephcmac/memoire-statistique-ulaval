	abstract = {Arsenic is the only environmental toxin that has been linked to both malignant and nonmalignant respiratory disease following ingestion, rather than inhalation, making arsenic a unique toxicant to the respiratory system. Chronic exposure to arsenic has been associated with the development of respiratory symptoms, impaired lung function, and chronic lung disease. Arsenic can also impair immune function, which can result in the lungs being more susceptible to respiratory infections and pulmonary inflammation. The lung is especially susceptible to arsenic exposure in utero and in early childhood while the lung is still developing. The risks of developing respiratory infections and respiratory diseases in early life and adulthood are greatest following in utero and early life exposure to arsenic. Currently, there are a limited number of studies that examine the longitudinal progression of arsenic-induced lung disease and describe the mechanisms by which arsenic damages the lung.}
